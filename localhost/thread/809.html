</style><div class="post">So I'm flat out <em>sick</em> of discord and it's unfairness.<br />
<br />
On December 3rd, 2018, there has been a mass banning of multiple members such as RicBent, shibboleet, Gimzie, naknow, newluigidev, Explos & Toms. Sounds familiar? These are the Super Mario Bros. Next developers.<br />
The reason for <em>all</em> above members is that they "Violated the Discord TOS", yet that's not the case for most.<br />
<br />
On December 1st, 2018, there has been a meme created by shibboleet that originated from MarioMaster's discord server. Basically, a bunch of users would change their name and avatar to "egbog". Some members decided to raid other servers with this new meme, in which the MMM discord server and the Horizon discord server were hit as well. The only person from the SMBNext development team that raided servers was Gimzie. Toms, Explos and the others didn't raid servers, and shibbo actively told others to not raid servers. Heck, RicBent wasn't aware of all what has happening, because he didn't even look inside the server for weeks. Though, that doesn't matter to the shameful Discord developers because some guy somehow got into the server and mass-reported everyone inside of it. The result? A bunch of people were banned (including some who left afterwards).<br />
<br />
The worst thing of all this is how Discord handled it. So far, the only ban I think is *somewhat* justified is Gimzie's ban but that's because he raided. The rest however.....<br />
According to the email RicBent got, it clearly states that a human (and not a bot) looked into the whole situation and found him guilty of breaking the TOS. Really? If they did really do their research, then why didn't they see that RicBent did nothing wrong? Why didn't they see that shibbo said that they should stop raiding? If RicBent really did violate the TOS, why didn't they explain *what* he broke in the email that he recieved.<br />
Worst of all, the SMBNext team needed to make an entirely new server just because of this, because the owner of the server (Explos) got banned and huseyin was only a moderator, which means that they couldn't get their server back.<br />
<br />
So RicBent tried to communicate with the discord three times on Twitter. He finally got a response...<a href="https://twitter.com/ricbent_/status/1069693678896197634?s=20">that he needed to do it via email</a>. Why did they just avoid the question? I understand that it isn't your department, but you could have had it forwarded to your TOS handle team or whatever. It doesn't even matter, because they didn't even reply to the emails <a href="../../cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/519268629997420546/519663470099038209/unknown.png">Gimzie</a> & <a href="https://twitter.com/tmolter123/status/1070072771122814977?s=20">Toms</a> sent to them.<br />
<br />
But at last, they finally responded to RicBent's email. You thought they could redo their "investigation", but <a href="https://twitter.com/ricbent_/status/1070087911608074240?s=20">nope</a>. You would expect the same treatment for everyone else, but that's not what happened.<br />
Shibboleet, a user who owns Discord Nitro, is the only account that got unbanned out of this whole mess. Though, RicBent did literally nothing and yet he's still banned. That's preferism to the core. Like, how can that be justified?<br />
<br />
Let's give a shortened down version of the issues with the Discord Team: They ban accounts for no reason, they fail to give legitimate support to their customers and are biased towards Nitro users<br />
<br />
Should I add more to this list? Sure.<br />
<br />
<div class="quote"> Plus, not to mention, here's an announcement noirscape made on the FreeShop discord server:<br />
<div class="quote">@everyone - hey guys. Sorry for the ping so early in the morning, but this is really important for your safety if you live in the United States.<br />
<br />
In the new Discord TOS Update, they **added an arbitration clause in it** that evoked your right to sue Discord (you must go through an arbitrator) and to congregate as a class action lawsuit.<br />
<br />
While you can find the exact clauses in the gist below, what you _should_ be doing right __***now***__ is sending an email to `arbitration-opt-out@discord.com` from the _registered email on your discord account_, saying you want to opt-out. I'd also recommend including your username/discriminator and ID in the email. Deleting your account will not opt you out of these terms<br />
<br />
__Why does this matter?__<br />
<br />
Without the ability to congregate for a class action lawsuit, if Discord ever leaks your data or does something catastrophically bad to a large portion of the population you have no way to representatively sue together without each of you individually suing via the arbitrator. <br />
<br />
__Why should I care? Other companies do it too!__<br />
<br />
By learning about this I hope that you will be more conscious about these arbitration clauses and how anti-consumer they are. You can't change the past, but you surely can't predict the future either.<br />
<br />
**Exact clauses:** &lt;https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/c93697c9d59ec2f0d8071b7d0e907632&gt; (credits to Rapptz/Danny from discord.py)<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, feel free to ask in #general</div>The fact that you can't sue them (without an arbitrator) is nonsense, especially considering <em>they</em>'re the ones that fucked up.<br />
<br />
I've had my own fair share of bullshit with discord too. My numerous bug reports were invalidated because "they're Windows 7 exclusive". In fact, they're the reason I upgraded to W10 in the first place: to avoid some of the bugs I had. <div class="quote-footer"><a href="../post/64193.html">Posted by Nightyoshi370</a></div></div><br />
They keep on actively screwing its own userbase by adding in random nonsense (like the game store aka them trying to be a monopoly) instead of sticking to their promises. The worst part is, they <strong>laugh</strong> about their shitty practices on their Twitter. For example: the Light Theme.<br />
It's completely unreadable and really hurts the eyes. So what do they do? Instead of fixing it or replacing it, they joke about how you would need a bunch of sunglasses in order to see it. It's worse than Mother 3 & Nintendo, because when the fans made a Mother 3 translation mod and Nintendo found out about it, they didn't kill the project. Discord? They say that using a modification to the client or enabling features that they purposely disabled (embeds on normal messages without links) is a bannable offense.<br />
<br />
Overall, while Discord might look easy to use compared to traditional forums (like Mario Making Mods), they also come at a risk of trying to ingulf you and try to get full control over you. I'm still going to stay on discord, but that's because I can't just abandon the discord server like that. Plus, who's not to say that I'm not gonna be pushing out an update pretty soon that converts this entire website to use Bootstrap 4 (which should, in turn, make using the website <em>much</em> more easier)?<br />
<br />
If you want an easy to use chat platform, just use IRC. It's open, self-hostable and has a multitude of clients (including a web client. The only way you can get that on Discord is through TitanEmbeds, which isn't that great).<br></div><div class="sig">Old 3DS XL info:<br />
I used to have a 3DSafe A9LH V11.3.0-36U with Luma in my CTRNAND. Since ReiNAND Reibooted and Re-Reileased, I "switch"ed back.<br />
Right now, I have boot9strap with Luma 8.0 as my CFW. Though, I'd like to see other CFW's for B9S.</div>

</style><div class="Toms-Background">    <div class="Toms-Post">As someone who has been affect by this very heavily by this, I'm just furious how everything has been handled. The most I've gotten from them was a message on twitter  telling me to reach out to their support team, and I've gotten nothing but automated messages ever since.<br />
<br />
Also about this: <br />
<div class="quote"> According to the email RicBent got, it clearly states that a human (and not a bot) looked into the whole situation and found him guilty of breaking the TOS. <div class="quote-footer"><a href="809-why-i-dislike-discord552e.html">Posted by NightYoshi370</a></div></div><br />
The message Bent received was also automated as i got the same exact message from them.<br />
<br />
Word. For. Word<br />
<br />
I just can't believe that Discord is outright ignoring me here. I had no clue of the incident going on at the time and I got banned for pretty much "Guilty by Association". They advertise themselves as a friendly community which I praised for the way that they did things. Then they had to be douches and throw me under the bus because whoever is in charge of support can't be bothered to actually look into what happened.<br />
<br />
I should be clear, I'm not angry about the ban itself, if a user is reported then the account should probably be banned. I' angry over the fact that I've tried over and over again to reach out and they act like I don't exist. If you're going to say that you have a  good support system, then honor what you say and actually have people that care about what is going on when something like this happens.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't recommend using their service after seeing how poorly long time users are treated and if I can't get anything done about this then I may have to leave the platform myself too.<br>_________________________<br></div>    <div class="Toms-Footer">        <center><br />

Not like any of the other staff team are any better:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">I'm extremely fed up with Discord in general. I've been coming to know a lot about the staff members (due to having been in a server that's closely affiliated with them).<br />
For example, there's staff members that <em>immediately nuke your whole account</em> if you even ping them once.<div class="quote-footer">Posted by SnakeBlock</div></div><br />
For me, my entire remains of my discord only depends on whether I want to abandon MMM or not, since people (<a href="../profile/109-buntendo.html" title=""><span  style="color: #FFEA95;" class="userlink" title="Buntendo (109) [Administrator]"><img src="../data/avatars/109_1572859516.png" alt="" class="minipic" /> Buntendo</span></a> is an example) are way too stuck up to Discord.<br />

He called it meh, even though it's basically Discord but has actual themes and self-hosted.<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, they follow European law about underage. What's the problem? they <strong>actively enforce that</strong>. If you are caught to have an underage person on your discord server, they will <em>ban</em> you. I understand to take it out on the member themself but to take it out on a server owner? Who told them to do that? It's just unjust, and so is everything that's happened so far.<br></div><div class="sig">Old 3DS XL info:<br />

				I can affirm the arbitration thing, as well as several other headaches I have had as an admin on another guild when it comes to interacting with Discord staff.<br />
<br />
There's a couple of incidents, but the one I'll focus on is a case of "shadowbanning" as it seems to be a shared issue Discord refuses to elaborate on.<br />
<br />
This happened to three people I know online. I won't give names for anonimity, but at least one user has had to wipe his account because at the time there was no known way to get around it.<br />
<br />
In summary, in some occasions, a user was forcibly removed from a guild. Attempting to get them to join said guild would just show an invalid invite. These users had no known alts that got banned on the guild, yet were unable to join. They weren't in the banlist either. Contacting Discord staff proved futile. The only way in which it was possible to make the user able to rejoin a guild was to <strong>manually ban them and then unban them again</strong>. Contacting Discord staff yielded the following answer (send twice, once to me, once to another guilds mod team): "The user might have been banned for using an alt. The only way to get the user to rejoin would be to clear the entire banlist as we don't give out IP adress info on accounts."<br />
<br />
Real helpful and basically dodging around this server glitch.<br />
<br />
There's more to talk about, including cases of Discords administration seeming to selectively enforce harassment reports, the odd case of my Hypesquad application going unmarked on my account but still getting their newsletter (had to bug them on Twitter to get the application to work properly) and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
Within regards to their trigger happiness for banning underage, this is basically COPPA. It's the dumbest law ever that doesn't massively dick the internet since it's basically impossible to enforce. COPPA is about privacy collecting on kids online. They have to enforce it, otherwise they get in legal trouble. If you as an admin knowingly keep an underage user on the guild, you are breaking their TOS. It's kinda simple to explain and a lot of sites really don't want to risk anything surrounding this law (related fact: GameFAQs used to ban people for being underage thanks to users making jokes that they were a fetus.) and Discord is hardly unique in that manner.<br />
<br />
FWIW, if you want some solid alternatives, maybe check these out:<br />
<br />
- Matrix is a program that's basically selfhosted Discord. It's got pretty much all the main features down pat. You can use a client like Riot to make it resemble Discord a lot. It's also federating, which means that users don't need accounts on each instance they wish to join but can join from a "central" account.<br />
- There's also good old IRC. Get a good client and it <em>doesn't</em> look like it's from the 90s. Something like TheLounge or Kiwi are good clients if you want a modern interface and if the interface doesn't matter, Hexchat will always suffice. Only disadvantage is no message history, but bouncers or public loggers can work around that.<br />

I'd also like to mention another way they are unproffesional: They actively encourage making new accounts, instead of, ya know, <strong>reactivating the old ones (the one with all the friends and messages under the account) even though they are flat out <a href="../../i.imgur.com/jzsNeFa.png">aware</a> that they're wrong.</strong><br />

<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UGJhITr7190" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<br />
These people are one of the most biased staff members I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
They ban people who dislike furries<br />
They unban people who have nitro.<br />
<br />
This kind of stuff needs to be shown to everyone. Unfortunately, when I tried showing it in the r/discordapp subreddit, a discord suckup was trying to stand his ground by ignoring everything I said and just assuming everything in this thread.<br />
<br />
Also, I'd like to bring up a conflicting point made in the video: The guy states that you can't ban evade. Then why do they <a href="../../i.imgur.com/jzsNeFa.png">actively encourage it</a>?<br />
If it looks like I'm angry over this and I'm just an angry teenager, well, that's because I am. They keep on doing stuff like this and it's really irritating.<br />
<br />
Also, they actively try to go against other people's privacy: <a href="../../cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/316917324806356994/535398816120307722/unknown.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/316917324806356994/535398816120307722/unknown.png</a><br />

Just, like, yikes from this service. Unfortunately, no one wants to switch over to anything else (rocketchat being a good example of underrated) so I guess we're stuck like this.<br></div><div class="sig">Old 3DS XL info:<br />

				On an unrelated note, the initial post stretches the page due to the quote padding seemingly being fixed. The same goes for YouTube embeds.<br />
<br />
I dislike Discord for a few other reasons such as the fact I've come across more creeps on it than any other service, the "pandering to meme lovers" mentality the development team have - they refuse to alter contrast of the light theme while acknowledging its problems (by forcing the dark theme for April Fools). Some people have a lot of difficulty reading dark themes (myself included). Many Discord-exclusive users also seem to conveniently ignore any other means of communication, and basically say "if you don't like Discord we can't talk", which is plain unfair. There was never this monopolisation of where to chat in the 90s-2000s, seems to mainly be a recent thing with the majority of current teenagers favouring lazy convenience over everything else.<br />
<br />
It could be worth mentioning that it seems there's a shitload of transtrenders appearing exclusively lately on Twitter/Discord. Hanging around those people's servers, I witnessed a lot of "lewd RP" with people who claimed to be MtF or such and didn't seem in the slightest like any cis girl I've met anywhere...<br>_________________________<br><div class="signature"><a href="https://www.retrogamingtalk.pw/">Retro Gaming Talk</a></div>
